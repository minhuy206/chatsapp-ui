# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Development Commands

**Development server**: `yarn dev` - Starts Vite dev server with HMR
**Build**: `yarn build` - TypeScript compilation + Vite production build
**Lint**: `yarn lint` - ESLint checks across the codebase
**Preview**: `yarn preview` - Preview production build locally

## Architecture Overview

This is a React + TypeScript + Vite application with TanStack Router for file-based routing and Tailwind CSS v4 for styling.

### Key Architecture Components

**Routing**: File-based routing using TanStack Router
- Routes defined in `src/routes/` directory
- `__root.tsx` provides the root layout with navigation
- `routeTree.gen.ts` is auto-generated by the TanStack Router plugin - never edit manually
- Router instance created in `main.tsx` with type safety registration

**Styling**: Tailwind CSS v4 + shadcn/ui setup
- Tailwind CSS v4 with Vite integration (`@tailwindcss/vite`)
- shadcn/ui component system configured (see `components.json`)
- CSS utility merger in `src/lib/utils.ts` using `clsx` + `tailwind-merge`
- Path aliases configured: `@/*` maps to `./src/*`

**Build Configuration**:
- Vite with React SWC plugin for fast compilation
- TanStack Router plugin with auto code splitting enabled
- TypeScript project references structure (`tsconfig.json` -> `tsconfig.app.json` + `tsconfig.node.json`)
- Path alias resolution configured in both Vite and TypeScript

### Important Auto-Generated Files

- `src/routeTree.gen.ts` - Generated by TanStack Router plugin, contains route tree structure
- This file is automatically updated when route files change and should never be edited manually

### Dependencies Structure

**UI & Styling**:
- `tailwindcss` + `@tailwindcss/vite` for Tailwind v4
- `class-variance-authority`, `clsx`, `tailwind-merge` for component styling utilities
- `lucide-react` for icons

**Routing**:
- `@tanstack/react-router` + `@tanstack/react-router-devtools` for routing
- `@tanstack/router-plugin` for Vite integration

### File Organization Patterns

Routes follow TanStack Router file-based conventions:
- `src/routes/__root.tsx` - Root layout component
- `src/routes/index.tsx` - Home page route
- Route files export `Route` created with `createFileRoute()` or `createRootRoute()`

Components and utilities:
- `src/lib/utils.ts` - Shared utility functions (currently CSS class merging)
- Path alias `@/` configured for clean imports from `src/`
